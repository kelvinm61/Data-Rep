# Data-Rep
### A To Do List
### Project for Data Representation and Querying 

HI, I created this programe for my module Data Representation and Querying. I chose to do a To Do list for this project. The program will take input from users and save the data input into a database using sqlite3. When the information is input the program will save it in the database and also make the newly saved information visible in the second tab called database. There is a third tab called Most forgotten items, I thaught this was a clever extra as even though we use to-do lists we still often forget to write things in them, so the third page is a list comprised of the most forgoetten items.The program is written mostly in Python and HTML. 


### Learning experience
I learned a lot from this project, I have never programed in python before so that was quite a challaneg picking up a new language and integrating it with html. I came across many stumbling blocks and tried to use couch db as the database server but found it very difficult so i tried to use sqlite and found it much more user friendly to create a database using python. I spent a lot of time on the internet trying to find workable code snippets for my project and even more time change them to make them compatable with my code. I tried straight away to make my code take in information on one page and output it on another but I found it to difficult straight away, so I got input and output to work on the one page before I seperated them and put them on to seperate pages. 

### Running the program
To run the To Do List we must go into terminal and then find the folder in documents,as my pyhton file is called webapp.py  We then type in 
```bash
$ python webapp.py
```
