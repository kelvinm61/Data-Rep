# Data-Rep
HI, I created this programe for my module Data Representation and Querying. I chose to do a To Do list for this project. The program will take input from users and save the data input into a database using sqlite3. When the information is input the program will save it in the database and also make the newly saved information visible in the second tab called database. There is a third tab called Most forgotten items, I thaught this was a clever extra as even though we use to-do lists we still often forget to write things in them, so the third page is a list comprised of the most forgoetten items.The program is written mostly in Python and HTML.
